# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

We'll learn the theory of neural networks, then use Python and NumPy to implement a complete multi-layer neural network. We'll cover the forward pass, loss functions, the backward pass (backpropagation and gradient descent), and the training loop. At the end, we'll use our neural network to predict the precipitation levels in NJ through the months of September-November.
